## Windows Forms-Factorio Image Converter
Functionally the same program as WPF-Factorio_Image_Converter but made using Windows Forms instead of Windows Presentation Foundation<br/>
Mainly used for development as designing apps is easier for me in Forms, however can be used anyone who prefers the Windows look of a program

#Development focus shift
This program will most probably stay in it's current form and won't be improved anymore, as I have moved my development efforts towards the WPF version of the program. I might come back to this sometime later if there is outside interest in it, but I seriously doubt that.
